## ðŸ§¾ Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker  
A modular and interactive data notebook that visualizes global COVID-19 metrics, with ICU and hospitalization insights, export options, and user input widgets.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives  
- Present global COVID-19 trends in a clean, engaging format  
- Enable interactive exploration via filters and dropdowns  
- Highlight key metrics like ICU usage and hospital capacity  
- Provide export options for PDF/HTML summaries and reports  
- Serve as a foundation for future public dashboards or teaching materials

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used  
| Tool/Library         | Purpose                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `pandas`             | Data manipulation and cleaning         |
| `numpy`              | Numeric computations                   |
| `plotly.express`     | Interactive, publication-ready charts  |
| `plotly.graph_objects` | Custom layout tweaks & styling     |
| `ipywidgets` (optional) | Interactivity in Jupyter notebooks |
| `IPython.display`    | Markdown, HTML, and widget rendering   |

Optional modules are auto-detected based on environment capabilities.

## ðŸš€ How to Run/View the Project  
1. **Download the notebook:** `COVID_Tracker.ipynb`  
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy plotly ipywidgets
   ```  
3. **Open in Jupyter or VSCode** with Python support  
4. **Use sidebar or widgets** to filter data by country, date range, or metric  
5. **Export insights:** Run the final cell for PDF/HTML summaries

To deploy publicly (e.g., Streamlit), consider converting core logic into `.py` scripts or a modular app layout. I can help with that next.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Reflections  
- ICU and hospitalization data vary widely between regions â€” normalization is key  
- Supporter-focused summaries improved retention and shareability  
- Removing branded styling made it easier to export and collaborate across teams  
- Modular cells and widgets allow quick adaptation to new datasets or goals  
- Next phase could include **predictive modeling** or a **Streamlit dashboard** for mobile accessibility
